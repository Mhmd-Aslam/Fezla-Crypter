# Fezla Crypter 🔐

Fezla Crypter is a secure communication app for Android and iOS that allows users to **encrypt and decrypt messages using AES encryption**. Built with **React Native**, **Expo**, and **TypeScript**, it offers a simple and secure way to protect your messages.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **AES Encryption**: Uses industry-standard AES algorithm for message security.
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with both Android and iOS devices.
- 🧠 **Simple Interface**: Easy to use, no technical background required.
- 📋 **Copy to Clipboard**: Quickly copy encrypted messages.
- 🔗 **Secure Sharing**: Share via WhatsApp, Telegram, or any messaging app.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Encryption**  
   - User A enters a secret message and a key.  
   - The app encrypts the message using AES and outputs ciphertext.

2. **Sharing**  
   - User A copies the ciphertext and shares it via any chat app.

3. **Decryption**  
   - User B pastes the ciphertext and enters the same key.  
   - The app decrypts the message and displays the original content.
